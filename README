This gem will simply generate the AWS EC2 signature so that you can use your own HTTP methods and libraries to POST to your choice of AWS/EC2 compatible API servers such as Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, OpenAuth.  Apparently, most of the AWS/EC2 API gems out there are not compatible with the aforementioned cloud frameworks, due to running on a custom port they do not account for that when generating the signature.  Fog had implemented a compatible signature method, however, I did not want to use the EXCON http library implemented in it so I extracted the signature method only for use with my own choice of HTTP library.

require 'ec2-signature'
# pass a hash containing your aws auth params to new obj
mysig = EC2Signature.new( {
            :access_id => ,
            :secret_key => ,
            :ec2_url => 'http://myec2server:8773/services/Cloud'
          } )
# generate the signature provided the query action you want to issue to your ec2 provider
signature = mysig.sign( {'Action' => 'DescribeImages'} )
# use the example net/http post method to post your signature to the ec2_url specified above
mysig.post signature

mysig.path = '/services/Admin'
# opennebula's aws/ec2 api implementation has a diff path for admin cmds
signature = mysig.sign( {
                'Action' => 'DescribeUser', 
                'Name' => 'jsmith',
              } )
mysig.post signature
